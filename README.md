So I had a data structures class a while back, and during the course of it I developed both an irritation with the
STL and a profound confusion as to why a String, being an unordered list of characters who's primary purpose seemed
to be that of modifying and printing out in an ordered sequence, would be treated like an array, and not a list.

So I made my own. It became somewhat of an obsessive hobby. And eventually, it seems I ended up with an array
anyways (Actually, it seems like what I ended up with was Haskell's list, just with an array underneath). But, I
like it, so I'm keeping it.
